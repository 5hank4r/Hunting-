Test for Logic Flaws

1.Identify the Key Attack Surface
 Logic fl aws can take a huge variety of forms and exist within any aspect
 of the application’s functionality. To ensure that probing for logic fl aws
 is feasible, you should fi rst narrow down the attack surface to a reason-
 able area for manual testing.

 Identify any instances of the following features:
 1. Multistage processes
 2.Critical security functions, such as login

 3.Transitions across trust boundaries (for example, moving from being
  4.anonymous to being self-registered to being logged in)
 5.Context-based functionality presented to a user
 6.Checks and adjustments made to transaction prices or quantities

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.Test Multistage Processes:
 The sequence of stages may be accessed via a series of GET or POST
 requests for distinct URLs, or they may involve submitting different
 sets of parameters to the same URL. You may specify the stage being
 requested by submitting a function name or index within a request
 parameter.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.Test Handling of Incomplete Input:
 For critical security functions within the application, which involve
 processing several items of user input and making a decision based on
 these, test the application’s resilience to requests containing incomplete
 input.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.Test Transaction Logic:
 the application imposes transaction limits, test the
 effects of submitting negative values. If these are accepted, it may be
 possible to beat the limits by making large transactions in the opposite
 direction.
