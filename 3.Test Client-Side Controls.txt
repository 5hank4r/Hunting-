Test Client-Side Controls

1.Test Transmission of Data Via the Client:

 Locate all instances within the application where hidden form fi elds,
 cookies, and URL parameters are apparently being used to transmit
 data via the client.
 
 Modify the item’s value in ways that are relevant to its role in the
 application’s functionality.

 If the application uses the ASP.NET ViewState , test to confi rm whether
 this can be tampered with or whether it contains any sensitive information.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.Test Client-Side Controls Over User Input:

 Identify any cases where client-side controls such as length limits and
 JavaScript checks are used to validate user input before it is submitted
 to the server. These controls can be bypassed easily, because you can
 send arbitrary requests to the server. 
 example:

 <form action=”order.asp” onsubmit=”return Validate(this)”>
 <input maxlength=”3” name=”quantity”>

 3.Test each affected input fi eld in turn by submitting input

 HTML form to identify any disabled elements, such as
 grayed-out submit buttons. For example:
 <input disabled=”true” name=”product”>

 4.Test Browser Extension Components:

  Understand the Client Application’s Operation
  Decompile the Client
  Attach a Debugger
  Test ActiveX controls
