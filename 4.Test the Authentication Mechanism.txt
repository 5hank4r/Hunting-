Test the Authentication Mechanism 


1.Test Password Quality:
  Review the application for any description of the minimum quality rules enforced on 
  user passwords

 Attempt to set various kinds of weak passwords, 
 using any self-registration or password change functions 
 to establish the rules actually enforced.

 Establish the authentication technologies in use (for example, forms, certificates, or multifactor).

 Attempt to log in using different variations on this
 password, by removing the last character, by changing a
 character’s case, and by removing any special characters. If any of these
 login attempts is successful, continue experimenting systematically to
 identify what validation is actually being performed.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.Test for Username Enumeration:

 Review every detail of the server’s responses to each pair of
 requests, including the HTTP status code, any redirects, information
 displayed on-screen, any differences hidden in the HTML page source,
 and the time taken for the server to respond.


 Locate any subsidiary authentication that accepts a username, and
 determine whether it can be used for username enumeration.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.Test Any Account Recovery Function:
 the application contains any facility for users to regain
 control of their account if they have forgotten their credentials.

 If the function uses a password hint, perform the same exercise to har-
 vest a list of password hints, and identify any that appear to be easily
 guessable.

6.Test Any Remember Me Function
 Test Any Impersonation Function
 Test Username Uniqueness
 Test Predictability of Autogenerated Credentials
 Check for Unsafe Transmission of Credential
 Check for Unsafe Distribution of Credentials
 Test for Insecure Storage

 7.Test for Logic Flaws
  Test for Fail-Open Conditions
  Test Any Multistage Mechanisms
  Exploit Any Vulnerabilities to Gain
  Unauthorized Access
