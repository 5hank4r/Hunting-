Test Access Controls

 Understand the Access Control Requirements
 
1.Test with Multiple Accounts:
  use a less-privileged account and attempt to access each item of this
 functionality.
 Using Burp, browse all the applicationâ€™s content within one user
 context.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.Test with Limited Access:
 Many common vulnerabilities will
 be much harder to locate, because you do not know the names of the URLs,
 identifi ers, and parameters that are needed to exploit the weaknesses.

 Decompile all compiled clients that are present, and extract any refer-
 ences to server-side functionality.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 3.Test for Insecure Access Control Methods:
  
  Some applications implement access controls based on request
  parameters in an inherently unsafe way.

 Some applications base access control decisions on the HTTP Referer header. 
 
 If HEAD is an allowed method on the site, test for insecure container-
 managed access control to URLs. Make a request using the HEAD method
 to determine whether the application permits it.
