Test for Shared Hosting Vulnerabilities

1.Test Segregation in Shared Infrastructures:

 If the application is hosted in a shared infrastructure, examine the access
 mechanisms provided for customers of the shared environment to update
 and manage their content and functionality.

 If you can achieve command execution, SQL injection, or arbitrary fi le
 access within one application, investigate carefully whether this provides
 any way to escalate your attack to target other applications

2.Test Segregation Between ASP-Hosted Applications:

 If the application belongs to an ASP-hosted service composed of a
 mix of shared and customized components, identify any shared com-
 ponents such as logging mechanisms, administrative functions, and
 database code components.
