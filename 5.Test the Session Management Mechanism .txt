Test the Session Management Mechanism 

 
1.Test Tokens for Meaning:
 Log in as several different users at different times, and record the tokens
 received from the server. If self-registration is available and you can choose
 your username.
 Analyze the tokens you receive for any correlations that appear to be
 related to the username and other user-controllable data.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.Test Tokens for Predictability:
 If you identify any patterns, capture a second sample of tokens using
 a different IP address and a different username. This will help you
 identify whether the same pattern is detected and whether tokens
 received in the fi rst exercise could be extrapolated to guess tokens
 received in the second.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.Check for Insecure Transmission of Tokens:

 starting with unauthenticated
 content at the start URL, proceeding through the login process, and
 then going through all the applicationâ€™s functionality.


4.If HTTP cookies are being used as the transmission mechanism for session tokens, 
 verify whether the secure fl ag is set, preventing them from
 ever being transmitted over HTTP connections.

 If the HTTPS area of the application contains any links to HTTP URLs,
 follow these and verify whether the session token is submitted. If it is,
 determine whether it continues to be valid or is immediately terminated
 by the server.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.Check for Disclosure of Tokens in Logs:

 If they are intended for administrators only, determine 
 whether any other vulnerabilities exist
 that could enable a lower-privileged user to access them.
 Identify any instances where session tokens are transmitted within the
 URL.If so, these may be transmitted in
 the Referer header when users follow any off-site links.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.Check Mapping of Tokens to Sessions:

 Log in and log out several times using the same user account, either from
 different browser processes or from different computers. Determine
 whether a new session token is issued each time, or whether the same
 token is issued every time the same account logs in.
 In this situation,there is no way to protect against concurrent logins or
 properly enforce session timeout.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7.Check for CSRF:
 If the application relies solely on HTTP cookies as its method of trans-
 mitting session tokens, it may be vulnerable to cross-site request forgery
 attacks.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8.Check Cookie Scope:
 If the application uses HTTP cookies to transmit session tokens (or
 any other sensitive data), review the relevant Set-Cookie headers, and
 check for any domain or path attributes used to control the scope of the
 cookies.
